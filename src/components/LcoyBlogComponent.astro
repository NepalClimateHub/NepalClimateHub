      LCOY Nepal 2025: Everything You Need to Know and How to Be Part of It
    </h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      If you've heard about LCOY Nepal 2025 and wondered what it is, how it
      works, and why it matters, you're in the right place. In this blog, we'll
      break down everything you need to know about LCOY and hopefully encourage
      your participation regardless of your knowledge level (because that's
      important!).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-content">
    <h2 class="blog-subheading">What is LCOY?</h2>
    <p>
      LCOY stands for Local Conference of Youth. It is a national-level climate
      conference officially endorsed by YOUNGO, the children and youth
      constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
      (UNFCCC).
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're new to climate change and these terms feel unfamiliar, that's
      completely okay. Everyone starts somewhere and LCOY could be your very
      first step into the climate movement. Let's take a step back to understand
      the basics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UNFCCC is an international treaty adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit
      in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It provides the foundational framework for
      global action on climate change. The treaty came into force in 1994 and
      now has 198 member countries, making it almost universally adopted. To
      manage its processes, the UNFCCC Secretariat was established, which
      organizes the annual COPs (Conferences of the Parties) and supports
      countries in implementing the treaty.
    </p>

    <p>
      YOUNGO is the official children and youth constituency of the UNFCCC. Its
      mission is to empower young people, build their capacity, and ensure their
      voices are heard in climate decision-making at all levels. The Local
      Conference of Youth (LCOY) is one of YOUNGO's most important mechanisms
      for achieving this.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-subheading">Why is LCOY Important?</h2>
    <p>
      LCOY is a structured platform for young people to engage in climate
      dialogue, policy, and action.
    </p>
    <ul class="lcoy-importance">
      <li>
        Youth across the country gather to learn, discuss, and collaborate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The outcome is a National Youth Declaration, a document with
        recommendations, policy demands, and action priorities from young
        people.
      </li>
      <li>
        This declaration is presented to the government to highlight what
        Nepalese youth expect in terms of climate action and policies.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But it doesn't stop there. The inputs from LCOY Nepal are carried forward
      to the Regional Conference of Youth (RCOY), where they are combined with
      youth perspectives from neighboring countries. From there, the outcomes
      move on to the Global Conference of Youth (COY), which takes place right
      before the annual COP (UN Climate Change Conference).
    </p>

    <p>
      This means the ideas and solutions you share in Nepal can travel all the
      way from local to global, influencing the discussions world leaders have
      at COP.
    </p>

    <p>This year marks the <strong>sixth edition of LCOY Nepal</strong>.</p>

    <ul class="history-list">
      <li>
        <strong>2020 (Virtual):</strong> The first-ever LCOY Nepal (Nov 21–22), organized
        by Climates Nepal and Youth Thinkers' Society Chitwan, held online due to
        COVID-19.

      <li>
        <strong>2021 (Virtual):</strong> Organized by CliMates Nepal, NYCA, and Youth
        Thinkers' Society Chitwan (Oct 8–9).
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
        <strong>2024 (In-person):</strong> Organized by Youth Action for Sustainable
        and Eco Nepal and Sustainability Week Kathmandu (Aug 3–4).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="blog-subheading">Why Should You Participate?</h2>
    <p>
      One of the best things about LCOY is that it is open to everyone from
      experienced climate activists to those just beginning their journey. You
      don't need to be an expert in climate science or policy to join.
    </p>
    <ul class="highlight-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Learn as You Go:</strong> LCOY is designed to grow your knowledge.
        You'll learn about climate basics, local solutions, and even how global negotiations
        work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Your Voice Matters:</strong> Climate change affects everyone. Your
        ideas and experiences are valuable, and LCOY is where they are recognized.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Connect and Network:</strong> Meet like-minded peers, local leaders,
        and organizations. Many collaborations, friendships, and projects start at
        LCOY.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be Part of a Global Movement:</strong> Your input doesn't stop at
        LCOY. It contributes to national, regional, and global youth statements that
        are presented to world leaders at UN climate negotiations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Empowerment and Action:</strong> You'll leave not just informed,
        but also inspired and equipped to act, whether in your community or on a
        larger scale.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Don't hold back because you feel you <strong>"don't know enough."</strong>
      LCOY is the place to learn, grow, and shape the climate conversation alongside
      other youth.
    </p>

    <h2 class="blog-subheading">Our Story Began at LCOY Nepal 2023</h2>
    <p>
      Two years ago, our founder Bibek almost skipped LCOY. Coming from a tech
      background, he thought climate conferences weren't for him. At the last
      moment, he applied and it changed everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of only a few computer science participants, and he left LCOY
      shocked, inspired, and empowered to do something meaningful. The lack of
      accessible digital climate resources later pushed him to start building
      Nepal Climate Hub.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "LCOY changed everything. My career choice, my goals, and my outlook. LCOY
      is where you meet enthusiastic minds across disciplines. Don't wait until
      you <strong>'know enough.'</strong> Sometimes, taking the first step is all
      it takes." – Bibek
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Today, Nepal Climate Hub stands as a nonprofit with a multidisciplinary
      team of 16 from all seven provinces and beyond (USA, Canada, Germany, and
      Scotland). Our Executive Director, Monica, was part of the organizing team
      for the first LCOY Nepal in 2020. Our Digital Community Manager, Gayatri,
      volunteered at LCOY 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are committed to bringing youth from diverse fields: engineering,
      technology, health, law, economics, and beyond into the climate space. We
      believe in more inclusive conversations, more collaboration, and more
      innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our simple goal: to make the climate journey easier for newcomers by
      curating and sharing beginner friendly resources. We are building an
      inclusive digital space for youth of Nepal to engage in conversation,
      share their expertise and collaborate to amplify the larger change in
      Nepalese climate movement.
    </p>

    <p class="closing">
      We look forward to seeing you at LCOY Nepal 2025. Join us, share your
      voice, and be part of the movement shaping our collective future.
    </p>
