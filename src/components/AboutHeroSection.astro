		Nepal Climate Hub was envisioned by Bibek, our founder, who recognized the need for a centralized climate platform after participating in the Local Conference of Youth Nepal 2023, part of YOUNGO, the official youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
	</h1>
	
	<p class="story-paragraph">
		Coming from a tech background, with little to no knowledge of climate change, he struggled to find clear, accessible information on local climate initiatives. The scattered and incomplete resources on the internet made it difficult to understand Nepal's climate landscape and take meaningful action. Realizing that others faced the same challenge, he envisioned a digital hub to simplify the climate journey for people like him.
	</p>
	
	<p class="story-paragraph">
		In March 2024, he joined the Climatebase Fellowship – an accelerator program for ambitious, mission-driven professionals in climate – where he teamed up with Elaine, Manon, and Tara to bring this idea to life. What began as a capstone project has now evolved into Nepal Climate Hub - a growing non-profit led by a passionate multidisciplinary team, driving action for a climate-resilient Nepal.
