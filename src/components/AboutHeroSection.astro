  <h1 class="story-heading">
    Nepal Climate Hub was envisioned by Bibek, our founder, who recognized <br/> the
    need for a centralized climate platform after participating in the Local <br/>
    Conference of Youth Nepal 2023, part of 
    <a 
      href="https://unfccc.int/topics/action-for-climate-empowerment-children-and-youth/youth/youngo" 
      target="_blank" 
      class="youngo-link"
    >YOUNGO</a>,
    the official youth <br/> constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate <br/>Change
    (UNFCCC).
  </h1>

  <p class="story-paragraph">
    Coming from a tech background, with little to no knowledge of climate
    change, he struggled to find clear, accessible information on local climate
    initiatives. <br />
    The scattered and incomplete resources on the internet made it
    difficult to understand Nepal's climate landscape and take meaningful
    action. Realizing that others faced the same challenge, he envisioned a
    digital hub to simplify the climate journey for people like him.
  </p>

  <p class="story-paragraph">
    In March 2024, he joined the Climatebase Fellowship – an accelerator program
    for ambitious, mission-driven professionals in climate – where he teamed up
    with Elaine, Manon, and Tara to bring this idea to life. <br />
    What began as a capstone project has now evolved into Nepal Climate Hub - a growing
    non-profit led by a passionate multidisciplinary team, driving action for a
    climate-resilient Nepal.
