				Nepal Climate Hub is a centralized platform built to educate, connect,
				and empower Nepalâ€™s young people to take positive climate action.
			</p>
			<p>
				The hub was conceived in March 2024 by Bibek Pant (a Nepal native and
				computer science graduate) as part of the <a href="https://climatebase.org/fellowship" target="_blank"
					>Climatebase Fellowship program</a
				>, to address a pressing need. Despite a rise in climate activism in
				Nepal in recent years, information and resources to enable effective
				action are often siloed and incomplete, resulting in fragmented efforts
				and a sense of overwhelm among those most motivated to drive meaningful
				positive change: students and young professionals across Nepal.
			</p>
			<p>
				Supported by an international Founding Team, all participants of the
				Climatebase Fellowship, Nepal Climate Hub aims to provide timely
				climate-related information, resources, and networking opportunities, as
				well as practical guidance to inspire individual and collective action
				to build a climate-resilient Nepal.
