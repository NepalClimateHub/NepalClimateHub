This year CliMates Nepal is organizing \"COP in My City Nepal 2024\" with the support of Open Dialogue on Climate Change (ODCC). This event is designed to empower and engage the youth of Nepal through an immersive and comprehensive understanding of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties (COP) mechanism. This dynamic three-day event will serve as a platform for young leaders, climate enthusiasts, and experts to come together and delve into the intricacies of international climate negotiations, policy-making processes, and climate action strategies. <br> The primary objective of \"COP in My City Nepal 2024\" is to bridge the gap between global climate policies and local realities. By simulating real-world climate negotiations, the event aims to equip participants with the skills and knowledge needed to actively participate in and influence climate policy discussions. Participants will engage in hands-on climate negotiation simulations that mirror the procedures of the actual UNFCCC COP, enabling them to experience the complexities and challenges of global climate governance. <br> In addition to the negotiation simulations, the event will feature a series of policy consultations that focus on the unique challenges and opportunities presented by Nepal's diverse landscapes and climate vulnerabilities. These consultations will bring together a diverse group of stakeholders, including government representatives, climate experts, local community leaders, and youth activists, to discuss and strategize on actionable solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. <br> Register: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMQIMeORm-hWqESUGOlgVjDI-LMF-bv9DA3vzhgXbE-fvRhA/viewform",

The event is titled 'International Dialogue on Mountain, People, and Climate.' <br> The conference aims to address the impact of climate change on mountain regions, formulate a unified stance among mountain countries on related issues, and enhance the effectiveness of both national and international initiatives. <br> Nepal has consistently highlighted the adverse effects of climate change on the mountainous ecological systems, the lives of people, and biodiversity in international forums. <br> The United Nations Climate Conference (COP-28), held in Dubai last year, marked the first significant initiative to tackle the impact of climate change on mountain areas. The Dubai conference directed the 60th meeting of the SBSTA to discuss mountain and climate change issues at an expert level. <br> In line with this directive, the mountain dialogue is being held in Nepal ahead of the SBSTA meeting scheduled for early June in Bonn, Germany.

The climate march was organised in Gauradha, Jhapa, Biratnagar and Udayapur of Koshi Province and Hetauda, Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Sindhuli of Bagmati Province. It was also followed in Pokhara and Lamjung of Gandaki Province and Bhairahawa of Lumbini Province. <br> Organiser of People's Climate March 2023, Sagar Koirala said, \"As world leaders gather at the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit on September 17, we want to raise millions of voices to pressurise stakeholders to stop the use of fossil fuel and focus on use of renewable energy sources.\" <br> \"Today, we joined hands in Patan of Lalitpur to demand swift, just, and equitable end to fossil fuels,\" he said, adding, \"It's time to make a change for our planet's future. We have to end fossil fuels and quickly make transition towards renewable energy.\" Climate advocates across different cities of Nepal have urged world leaders to undertake a rapid, equitable and just fossil fuel phase-out to protect the people and planet, said Omkar Subedi, an activist from People's Climate Mobilisation Team. He further said, \"With so many deceptive excuses, governments are expanding rather than phasing out gas and oil.
