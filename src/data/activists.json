I have collaborated with young people worldwide to advocate for youth involvement in decision-making and climate education. Currently, I serve as the Advocacy Coordinator for the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, leading campaigns and building youth capacity on climate-induced loss and damage. I also manage projects and develop campaigns on clean energy and climate change as a Policy Advisor at Clean Energy Nepal. Additionally, I engage with global and local youth networks as a Youth Advisor for The Iris Project and mentor prize winners. <br> My previous roles include being a member of the EE 30 Under 30 program by North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE), and a Board Member at Clean Energy Nepal. I volunteered for the NDC Project at Care About Climate and worked with YOUNGO as the Contact Point for the Nationally Determined Contributions Working Group. I coordinated campaigns and served as a delegate for Mock COP26 and represented Nepal as a Youth Delegate at COP26 and COP25. I was a Youth Climate Change Champion for UNICEF, participated in various youth conferences, and worked on youth-led climate initiatives. My early career involved roles such as Network Coordinator and School and College Coordinator for NYCA Nepal, and I also taught science and environment at Himchuli English Higher Secondary School. Throughout my career, I have been committed to driving meaningful climate action and empowering young people to lead the charge in climate justice. <br> My story has been featured in 'Stone Soup for a Sustainable World' and '50 Girls Saving Our Planet.' In 2022, I received the 'Youth of the Year' award for my climate action efforts. In my spare time, I love reading, traveling to natural places, and catching up on sleep.",

I have collaborated with young people worldwide to advocate for youth involvement in decision-making and climate education. Currently, I serve as the Advocacy Coordinator for the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, leading campaigns and building youth capacity on climate-induced loss and damage. I also manage projects and develop campaigns on clean energy and climate change as a Policy Advisor at Clean Energy Nepal. Additionally, I engage with global and local youth networks as a Youth Advisor for The Iris Project and mentor prize winners. <br> My previous roles include being a member of the EE 30 Under 30 program by North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE), and a Board Member at Clean Energy Nepal. I volunteered for the NDC Project at Care About Climate and worked with YOUNGO as the Contact Point for the Nationally Determined Contributions Working Group. I coordinated campaigns and served as a delegate for Mock COP26 and represented Nepal as a Youth Delegate at COP26 and COP25. I was a Youth Climate Change Champion for UNICEF, participated in various youth conferences, and worked on youth-led climate initiatives. My early career involved roles such as Network Coordinator and School and College Coordinator for NYCA Nepal, and I also taught science and environment at Himchuli English Higher Secondary School. Throughout my career, I have been committed to driving meaningful climate action and empowering young people to lead the charge in climate justice. <br> My story has been featured in 'Stone Soup for a Sustainable World' and '50 Girls Saving Our Planet.' In 2022, I received the 'Youth of the Year' award for my climate action efforts. In my spare time, I love reading, traveling to natural places, and catching up on sleep.",

		"description": "Hi! I am Shreya KC, a passionate climate justice activist from Nepal. I have collaborated with young people worldwide to advocate for youth involvement in decision-making and climate education. Currently, I serve as the Advocacy Coordinator for the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition, leading campaigns and building youth capacity on climate-induced loss and damage. I also manage projects and develop campaigns on clean energy and climate change as a Policy Advisor at Clean Energy Nepal. Additionally, I engage with global and local youth networks as a Youth Advisor for The Iris Project and mentor prize winners. <br> My previous roles include being a member of the EE 30 Under 30 program by North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE), and a Board Member at Clean Energy Nepal. I volunteered for the NDC Project at Care About Climate and worked with YOUNGO as the Contact Point for the Nationally Determined Contributions Working Group. I coordinated campaigns and served as a delegate for Mock COP26 and represented Nepal as a Youth Delegate at COP26 and COP25. I was a Youth Climate Change Champion for UNICEF, participated in various youth conferences, and worked on youth-led climate initiatives. My early career involved roles such as Network Coordinator and School and College Coordinator for NYCA Nepal, and I also taught science and environment at Himchuli English Higher Secondary School. Throughout my career, I have been committed to driving meaningful climate action and empowering young people to lead the charge in climate justice. <br> My story has been featured in 'Stone Soup for a Sustainable World' and '50 Girls Saving Our Planet.' In 2022, I received the 'Youth of the Year' award for my climate action efforts. In my spare time, I love reading, traveling to natural places, and catching up on sleep.",
