Population growth, fragile ecosystem, unsustainable developmental activities, exploitation of natural resources and climatic change are major environmental challenges for today’s generation of Nepal. Low level of public sensitization, weak institutional capacity, lack of appropriate monitoring mechanism of environmental problem and policy loopholes are exacerbating the environmental challenge in Nepal. Considering such situations, Youth Alliance for Environment (YAE) was formed to tackle challenges through research, evidence based policy advocacy, capacity building and community mobilization for the environmental conservation and promoting sustainable development. <br> YAE was established in 2009 with the objective to conserve environment by mitigating existing environmental challenges from the efforts of environmental professionals.

This is NASA’s global hackathon, first held in April 2012, and serves as an innovation incubation and civic engagement program. The team developed an app “CLEAN KTM” which is a crowdsourcing platform to report and manage waste problems in Kathmandu Valley. <br> The idea won the competition. This victory became a huge source of encouragement for the team to establish their own entity in Nepal and work further on the development of technological solutions for local problems mobilizing the local youths in Nepal. NAXA has since been striving to build partnerships with agencies that promote recent technologies for better performance. Since the 2015 Nepal Earthquake, NAXA has been extensively involved in ideation, design and implementation of several technologies in disaster risk reduction initiatives.",
