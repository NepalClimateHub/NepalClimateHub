		"description": "Nepalese Youth for Climate Action (NYCA) is a youth-led coalition of Nepalese youth and youth groups dedicated to tackling climate change, which is the most significant challenge of our generation. Established on August 10, 2008, NYCA operates under the motto “Caring for Climate, Caring for Ourselves.” The organization strives to raise awareness about climate change on local, national, and international levels, educate and empower youth, and build networks of young people engaged in climate campaigns. <br> NYCA's objectives are multifaceted and ambitious. The organization aims to mobilize youth to achieve its goals and vision by conducting research and studies on various components of climate change. It supports the Nepalese government in international negotiations to advocate for Nepal’s and its member coalition's positions. Additionally, NYCA puts pressure on large greenhouse gas-emitting countries to make significant emission reductions and urges developed countries to provide adequate and predictable financial support for adaptation and technology transfer to developing countries. Moreover, NYCA campaigns for the Nepalese government to transition towards a low-carbon economy. <br> The overarching goal of NYCA is to protect Nepal and its people from the adverse impacts of climate change by spreading awareness, advocating for effective policies, and taking concrete actions. The organization aims to lead Nepal towards climate resilience by spearheading adaptation efforts and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. NYCA envisions an economically prosperous and sustainable Nepal where youth actively lead society towards a cleaner and more sustainable future.",
