They apply the methods and skills that are covered to give an interactive digital presentation.  \\n Seed funding: As the externship concludes, participants can apply for seed funding to begin to enact the solutions they identified in their communities. \\n Students who successfully complete their externships will receive their educational stipends ($500) at the end of the program.
